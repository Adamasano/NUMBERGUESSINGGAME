The "Guess the Number" project is a simple Java game where the computer generates a random number (1-100). 
The user guesses the number through a dialog box. 
The program indicates if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
Features include limiting attempts, multiple rounds, scoring based on attempts, and point rewards for correct guesses.
